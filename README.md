## 📋 Overview

This tool uses a combination of Reddit's API and AI models (OpenAI or Anthropic) to:

1. Scrape boating, sailing, marine DIY, and adjacent communities for bilge pump and water-intrusion discussions
2. Identify posts that express recurring maintenance pain, praise, or frustration with marine equipment
3. Score and analyze posts using sentiment, relevance, confidence, and issue heat
4. Store results in a local SQLite database for review
5. Browse and filter results through an interactive web dashboard

The application maintains a balance between focused and exploratory subreddits, intelligently refreshing the exploratory list based on marine-adjacent discoveries. This exploration process happens automatically as part of the main workflow.

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Reddit API credentials ([create an app here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps))
- OpenAI API key **or** Anthropic API key (configurable via `config.yaml`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mohamedsaleh14/Reddit_Scrapper.git
   cd Reddit_Scrapper
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables by copying `.env.template` to `.env`:
   ```
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

5. Edit `.env` and add your API credentials:
   ```
   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   REDDIT_USER_AGENT=script:marine-bilge-sentiment-explorer:v1.0 (by /u/yourusername)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

Configure the application by editing `config/config.yaml`. Key settings include:

- **AI provider**: Choose between `openai` or `anthropic` as the batch processing backend
- **Target subreddits**: Primary boating/marine subreddits and exploratory subreddit settings
- **Post age range**: Only analyze posts within the configured age window
- **API rate limits**: Prevent hitting Reddit API limits
- **AI models**: Per-provider model configuration for filtering and deep analysis
- **Monthly budget**: Cap total API spending
- **Scoring weights**: How to weight different factors (relevance, pain point clarity, emotional intensity, implementability, technical depth) when scoring posts
- **Token limits**: Per-model enqueued token limits for batch API submissions

## 🏃‍♀️ Running

### One-time Run

To run the pipeline once:

```
python3 main.py
```

This will:
1. Scrape posts from configured primary subreddits
2. Automatically discover and scrape from exploratory subreddits
3. Analyze all posts with GPT models
4. Store results in the database

### Scheduled Operation

To run the pipeline daily at the configured time (TODO, Fix scheduler):

```
python3 scheduler/daily_scheduler.py
```

## 🖥️ GUI Dashboard

After running the pipeline at least once, you can explore the results using the interactive Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
./run_gui.sh
```

Or run it directly:

```bash
streamlit run gui/gui.py --server.port 8501 --server.address localhost
```

The dashboard provides:

- **Sentiment filtering** — Adjust sliders for sentiment magnitude, relevance, confidence, and pain score to focus on the posts that matter most
- **Subreddit filters** — Multi-select filters to narrow results by source subreddit
- **Sorting** — Sort by sentiment heat, sentiment score, relevance, confidence, or post date, ascending or descending
- **Pagination** — Browse through large result sets 10 posts at a time
- **Post cards** — Each post displays sentiment, score, confidence, relevance, heat, complaint or praise summary, tags, and a link to the original Reddit thread
- **Expandable details** — Click into any post to read the body text, AI-generated justification, product mention, aspects, and market-opportunity notes
- **Summary statistics** — Sidebar shows total posts with average sentiment, heat, relevance, and confidence for the current filter

## 📊 Results

Results are stored in a SQLite database at `data/db.sqlite`. Besides the GUI, you can query it directly:

```sql
-- Today's top signals
SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE processed_at >= DATE('now')
ORDER BY ABS(COALESCE(sentiment_score, 0)) DESC, relevance_score DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Posts with specific tag
SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE tags LIKE '%bilge%'
ORDER BY processed_at DESC;
```

## 🔒 Cost Controls

The application includes several safeguards to control API costs:

- Monthly budget cap (configurable in `config.yaml`)
- Efficient batch processing using OpenAI's Batch API or Anthropic's Message Batches API
- Per-model enqueued token limits to avoid provider quota issues
- Automatic OpenAI storage cleanup (removes accumulated batch input/output files)
- Parallel batch submission with token-aware scheduling
- Partial result recovery from expired batches
- Pre-filtering with less expensive models before using more powerful models
- Cost tracking and logging

## 🙋‍♂️ Why This Exists

This tool is being repurposed as a university final-year engineering project for market research on marine bilge pumps. The original Reddit credential and scraping flow remain intact, but the analysis layer now focuses on sentiment, complaint clustering, and equipment-specific research signals.

If you're using it for research, the most useful next step is usually to tune the tracked subreddits and the prompt templates for your exact marine equipment scope.
